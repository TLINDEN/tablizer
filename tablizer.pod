=head1 DESCRIPTION

Many  programs generate  tabular output.   But sometimes  you need  to
post-process these tables, you may need  to remove one or more columns
or you  may want to filter  for some pattern (See  L<PATTERNS>) or you
may need the  output in another program and need  to parse it somehow.
Standard unix tools such as awk(1), grep(1) or column(1) may help, but
sometimes it's a tedious business.

Let's take  the output of  the tool  kubectl.  It contains  cells with
withespace and they do not separate columns by TAB characters. This is
not easy to process.

You can use B<tablizer> to do these and more things.

B<tablizer>  analyses the  header  fields of  a  table, registers  the
column positions of  each header field and separates  columns by those
positions.

Without any options it reads its input from C<STDIN>, but you can also
specify a  file as a  parameter. If you want  to reduce the  output by
some regular expression,  just specify it as its  first parameter. You
may also  use the  B<-v> option  to exclude all  rows which  match the
pattern. Hence:

   # read from STDIN
   kubectl get pods | tablizer

   # read a file
   tablizer filename

   # search for pattern in a file (works like grep)
   tablizer regex filename

   # search for pattern in STDIN
   kubectl get pods | tablizer regex

The output  looks like the  original one  but every header  field will
have a numer associated with it, e.g.:

   NAME(1) READY(2) STATUS(3) RESTARTS(4) AGE(5)

These numbers denote the column and  you can use them to specify which
columns you want to have in your output (see L<COLUMNS>:

   kubectl get pods | tablizer -c1,3

You can specify the numbers in any order but output will always follow
the original order.

The numbering can be suppressed by using the B<-n> option.

By  default tablizer  shows  a  header containing  the  names of  each
column.  This can  be disabled using the B<-H> option.   Be aware that
this only affects tabular output modes.  Shell, Extended, Yaml and CSV
output modes always use the column names.

By  default, if  a  B<pattern>  has been  speficied,  matches will  be
highlighted. You can disable this behavior with the B<-N> option.

Use the  B<-k> option to specify  by which column to  sort the tabular
data (as in GNU sort(1)). The default sort column is the first one. To
disable sorting at all, supply 0  (Zero) to -k. The default sort order
is ascending. You can change this to descending order using the option
B<-D>. The default  sort order is by string, but  there are other sort
modes:

=over

=item B<-a --sort-age>

Sorts duration strings like "1d4h32m51s".

=item B<-i --sort-numeric>

Sorts numeric fields.

=item B<-t --sort-time>

Sorts timestamps.

=back

Finally the  B<-d> option  enables debugging  output which  is mostly
useful for the developer.

=head2 PATTERNS AND FILTERING

You can reduce the rows being  displayed by using a regular expression
pattern.  The  regexp is  PCRE compatible, refer  to the  syntax cheat
sheet here: L<https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>.  If you want
to read  a more comprehensive  documentation about the topic  and have
perl installed you can read it with:

    perldoc perlre

Or read it online: L<https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre>.

A note on  modifiers: the regexp engine used in  tablizer uses another
modifier syntax:

    (?MODIFIER)

The most important modifiers are:

C<i> ignore case
C<m> multiline mode
C<s> single line mode

Example for a case insensitive search:

    kubectl get pods -A | tablizer "(?i)account"

You  can use  the experimental  fuzzy seach  feature by  providing the
option B<-z>, in which case the  pattern is regarded as a fuzzy search
term, not a regexp.

Sometimes you want to  filter by one or more columns.  You can do that
using the B<-F> option. The option can be specified multiple times and
has the following format:

    fieldname=regexp

Fieldnames (== columns headers) are case insensitive.

If you specify more than one filter, both filters have to match (AND
operation).

If the option B<-v> is specified, the filtering is inverted.


=head2 COLUMNS

The  parameter  B<-c>  can  be  used  to  specify,  which  columns  to
display.  By default  tablizer numerizes  the header  names and  these
numbers can  be used to specify  which header to display,  see example
above.

However, beside  numbers, you  can also  use regular  expressions with
B<-c>, also  separated by comma. And  you can mix column  numbers with
regexps.

Lets take this table:

        PID TTY          TIME CMD
      14001 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
      42871 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
      42872 pts/0    00:00:00 sed

We want to see only the CMD column and use a regex for this:

    ps | tablizer -s '\s+' -c C
    CMD(4)
    bash
    ps
    tablizer
    sed

where "C" is our regexp which matches CMD.

=head2 OUTPUT MODES

There might be cases  when the tabular output of a  program is way too
large  for your  current  terminal but  you still  need  to see  every
column.   In such  cases the  B<-o extended>  or B<-X>  option can  be
useful which enables I<extended mode>. In  this mode, each row will be
printed vertically,  header left,  value right,  aligned by  the field
widths. Here's an example:

    kubectl get pods | ./tablizer -o extended
        NAME: repldepl-7bcd8d5b64-7zq4l  
       READY: 1/1    
      STATUS: Running  
    RESTARTS: 1 (71m ago)  
         AGE: 5h28m

You can  of course  still use  a regex  to reduce  the number  of rows
displayed.

The option B<-o shell>  can be used if the output  has to be processed
by the shell,  it prints variable assignments for each  cell, one line
per row:

    kubectl get pods | ./tablizer -o extended ./tablizer -o shell
    NAME="repldepl-7bcd8d5b64-7zq4l" READY="1/1" STATUS="Running" RESTARTS="9 (47m ago)" AGE="4d23h" 
    NAME="repldepl-7bcd8d5b64-m48n8" READY="1/1" STATUS="Running" RESTARTS="9 (47m ago)" AGE="4d23h" 
    NAME="repldepl-7bcd8d5b64-q2bf4" READY="1/1" STATUS="Running" RESTARTS="9 (47m ago)" AGE="4d23h" 

You can use this in an eval loop.

Beside normal  ascii mode  (the default) and  extended mode  there are
more output modes available: B<orgtbl>  which prints an Emacs org-mode
table and  B<markdown> which prints  a Markdown table,  B<yaml>, which
prints  yaml encoding  and CSV  mode, which  prints a  comma separated
value file.

=head2 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

B<tablizer> supports  certain environment variables which  use can use
to  influence   program  behavior.   Commandline  flags   have  always
precedence over environment variables.

=over

=item <T_NO_HEADER_NUMBERING> - disable numbering of header fields, like B<-n>.

=item <T_COLUMNS> - comma separated list of columns to output, like B<-c>

=item <NO_COLORS> - disable colorization of matches, like B<-N>

=back

=head2 COMPLETION

Shell completion for command line options  can be enabled by using the
B<--completion>  flag. The  required  parameter is  the  name of  your
shell. Currently supported are: bash, zsh, fish and powershell.

Detailed instructions:

=over

=item Bash:

   source <(tablizer --completion bash)

To load completions for each session, execute once:

  # Linux:
  $ tablizer --completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/tablizer

  # macOS:
  $ tablizer --completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/tablizer

=item Zsh:

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

  echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions for each session, execute once:

  $ tablizer --completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_tablizer"

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

=item fish:

   tablizer --completion fish | source

To load completions for each session, execute once:

   tablizer --completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/tablizer.fish

=item PowerShell:

   tablizer --completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

To load completions for every new session, run:

   tablizer --completion powershell > tablizer.ps1

and source this file from your PowerShell profile.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND COLORS

YOu can put certain configuration values into a configuration file in
HCL format. By default tablizer looks for
C<$HOME/.config/tablizer/config>, but you can provide one using the
parameter C<-f>.

In the configuration the following variables can be defined:

    BG             = "lightGreen"
    FG             = "white"
    HighlightBG    = "lightGreen"
    HighlightFG    = "white"
    NoHighlightBG  = "white"
    NoHighlightFG  = "lightGreen"
    HighlightHdrBG = "red"
    HighlightHdrFG = "white"

The following color definitions are available:

black, blue,  cyan, darkGray, default, green,  lightBlue, lightCyan,
lightGreen,   lightMagenta,   lightRed,   lightWhite,   lightYellow,
magenta, red, white, yellow

The Variables B<FG> and B<BG> are being used to highlight matches. The
other *FG and *BG variables are for colored table output (enabled with
the C<-L> parameter).

Colorization can be turned off completely either by setting the
parameter C<-N> or the environment variable B<NO_COLOR> to a true value.
